Vaporwave official turns 10 today!,695,cfc215,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/cfc215/vaporwave_official_turns_10_today/,39,1563593650.0,"On this day, July 19th, in 2009, American electronic music producer Daniel Lopatin released three new songs to YouTube under the pseudonym 'Sunset Corp'. These three tracks are widely regarded as the beginnings of an entirely new musical genre.

Two of these songs feature very prominent samples, one from Chris De Burgh's 1986 track ""Lady in Red"" looping on the phrase ""There's nobody here"" for two minutes. The other, samples Fleetwood Mac's 1982 song ""Only Over You"" repeating on ""Angel Please don't go, I miss you when you're gone"". 

Later in 2011, Portland, Oregon, based artist Romona Xavier, aka Vektroid, would build on this work with the release of ""Floral Shoppe"" posted under the one-time alias of ""Macintosh Plus"". The most recognizable of these songs was a slowed-down, pitch-shifted, Chopped-n-Screwed rendition of the Diana Ross song ""It's your move"" going under the name ""„É™„Çµ„Éï„É©„É≥„ÇØ420 / Áèæ‰ª£„ÅÆ„Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Éº"" or alternatively, ""Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing"". This track would go on to popularize the internet-based music genre known as ""Vaporwave"" which is officially ten years old as of today. 

Thank you all for being a part of this community. I love you all.

It's been especially bad lately since I lost my job due to the whole COVID fiasco. But I can always sit or lay down, turn on some vaporwave music, and calm down and feel a litter better and happier.
