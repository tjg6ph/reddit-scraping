Call it hiraeth, hauntology or relatability. It's pieces of each*\n\nNow I will develop further as a music genre:\n\n* Concept Music: Most albums and Singles, when done right, are not just \"Cool for the sake of Cool\". They are created with the purpose of being listened through a presentation, scenario, and narrative. A good vaporwave albums tells you a story or places you in a location. Without the story the song is nice, but the connection to a narrative gives it something to draw around the song. Suddenly the filter fade means leaving the town behind, suddenly the piano growing into a full orchesta means finally kissing your loved one, suddenly the sample choice is blatanly telling you that your not in the real world.\n\n* Very Specific Scenarios: Does anyone remember those memes that got popular some time ago that consisted on \"X song but it's playing on Y scenario\"?. Vaporwave works like that. Both appealed to you despite not being an scenario you had particulary experienced yourself. But you had an idea on what that was supposed to feel based on related or similar connection your brain made. While the meme was very literal, Vaporwave decides to let your brain fill the story beats yourself after giving you the outline.\n\n* Most Commonly Understandable Music Terms: Although simbolism and metaphore is totally a thing in the creation of any artpiece, when it comes to producing an effect, reaction or emotion in a listener, there are well known methods to achieve them. Brand idealization sounds like clean easygoing music, Romance sounds like slow and sexy saxophones, Dreams sound like echoey diffuse chaotic sounds, etc...\n\nAll that together creates a scenario where An Artist creates The Outline of a narrative, gives you some plot points as titles of songs and then launches you into drawing the rest of the story in your head, as you and only you visualize it, and in the process, you get emotional responses.\n\nI tried to condense it as much as i could. i hope this theory lasts as much as it can without destroying the", "", "I don't know if this has been posted already but Andy's Record Store repressed and released Floral Shoppe on wax for sale last week\n\nLink 1: [https://twitter.com/RickmanAndy/status/1200191139850194949](https://twitter.com/RickmanAndy/status/1200191139850194949) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it seems like he has been getting some brushback from people about it potentially being a scam\n\nLink 2: [https://twitter.com/RickmanAndy/status/1200458997087772673](https://twitter.com/RickmanAndy/status/1200458997087772673) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any insight on this.

I'm the owner of [this playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7y28m8n1H5skKx16RHFTof?si=0sdylYkzSdKQssI1bpn4JA). It's a mix of City pop, Japanese 80s soul, future funk, vaporwave and some lofi hiphop. However, I feel like I haven't added anything new to it in a long time. Maybe someone here knows if there's some good vaporwave tunes released on Spotify lately. Hit me up with suggestions if there's some good new stuff which I could add!\n\n(ps. not asking for suggestions which aren't available on Spotify ds.)"]}
