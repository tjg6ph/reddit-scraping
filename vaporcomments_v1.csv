"Had someone from the vaporwave community taken a photo of him and given it to Macintosh Plus he could still be on the cover of the official album. The copyright claim was on the photo, not the statue itself"

I propose the Vaporwave Community leave votive offerings a la Jim Morrisons grave in Paris.

"cant tell if you are joking so I'll just be informative.

Sculptors of the time favored the ""ideal form"" and so made pretty much everyone look very similar rather than true to life, this is often exaggerated in mythical subjects because nobody can say ""that looks nothing like Terry"""
"There's increasing evidence from x-ray spectroscopy that [the statues were painted](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5616498/ultraviolet-light-reveals-how-ancient-greek-statues-really-looked), so they would have been more distinct back then."

"Just turn on some fluorescent lights, grab a plastic palm tree, and let your head melt into a puddle of Crystal Pepsi trickling down the bust of a statue in the breeze of southern suburbia on a hazy summer's eve while you're out eating acid with some friends all mall ratting around the dot com bubble gum stuck to your high top facade of yesteryear as you cry another pint into reminiscing about the nonexistent American Dreamcast that never came to be for a generation that knew the taste of pre2k just long enough to feel the sting of the coming ubiquity of low low prices!"

"I chose homo exactly because it means ""human being"" (same for ἄνθρωπος). Do you prefer a vaporwave ""guy"" or ｔｈｅ ｕｎｉｖｅｒｓａｌ ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ ｍａｎ? (yes Leonardo, the world misses you)

Vaporum is the plural genitive of vapor. If you prefer the singular form it's vaporis."
"It's also worth noting that, on top of an ideal formula for faces/bodies, artists would intentionally depict real people of power like Alexander like the various gods of the pantheon (in this case, Helios), in order to draw a connection between the two. "

"Haha, that's a cool pun! Approved."
"But vaporwave is an English neologism (mainly used as an adjective, moreover) and Latin doesn't have a corresponding one. So the only word you can use is vapor, which is a noun, and in particular its genitive form, vaporis/vaporum, i.e. ""of vapor""."

"Alright, then we should invent a new Latin word! There are two ways to do this: doing a phonetic transposition, resulting in *vaporwavus* (or different forms... the problem is the letter W doesn't exist in Latin alphabet); or doing a real translation, and I think it would be *vaporunda* for the noun and *vaporundus* for the adjective (being unda the Latin translation of wave)."
