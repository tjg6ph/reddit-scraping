This is my favorite Zelda song of all time. I love this and I love you.
"Wow, just a couple days ago I was thinking about this song and looked it up to listen to it again.   
The original alone already kinda has that vapor vibe."
"This song always seems to touch people in some unspoken way. It gives me some feelings of something long past, and I can put my finger on it."
This is really good! I would love to hear what you can do with zora's domain
"This is dope. Mixing it with the Mayor Meeting theme too was brilliant.

Big fan of your OOT Zeldawave, didn't realize you'd made a MM one too! I know what I'm jamming to today."
"Great source material man, totally forgot how much I loved this track as a kid. Mix is cool too"
Fav game ever
"This is very interesting

I never played Majora's mask but I feel like through cultural osmosis I have a connection to gaming of that era before the internet"
"I had listened to Zeldawave 1 several times on YT, and I just happened to log in at the perfect time when you streamed the premiere of 2. Great work! Love the song and all the work you did."
"Yessss I've always wanted something like this, now we just need a Fairy Fountain one ;)"
This is amazing; thank you for this.
Fuck yeah ü§ôü§ôü§ô
Killer man!! Keep it up!
Dopeüåù
I saw this in my recommendedations but i didnt know its you lol
"This is super fire, I wonder if you can path these songs in the game üßê"
"My roommate and I came across your videos a few weeks ago.   


He referred to it as weaponized nostalgia lol"
I.. I love you. This was my fav Zelda song as a kid even today. My heart.. my feels
"This is so good, thank you for making this!"

"It's by far the best Zelda, IMO. Well, maybe BotW has usurped it now. But the existentialism and structure of gameplay have never been replicated."
"I've actually remixed Fairy Fountain twice!

Once for [Ocarina of Time](https://youtu.be/bHUvykXL8Og?t=2m28s) and once for [Majora's Mask](https://youtu.be/kQXsiJ1lLss?t=1m15s)"

It's almost surreal?
So you're the artist who uploaded Zeldawave I & II on YouTube? I listen to those so much!
"Yep üëΩ

Thanks for listening!"
